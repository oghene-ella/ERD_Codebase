# Migrations, Seeders and Authentication

## Using Mongoose, 
1. create the necessary schemas and models. 
2. Seed an admin user and 10 or more items into your database
3. Create a route for a user to signup, login and view the list of items


## Things to Note:

- In this implementations, the route to get the list of items must be authenticated
- Use JWT for authentication
- Ensure your JWT expires after 1 hour
- Add a .env.example file
- Ensure password is encrypted
